# Pi AutoSync StableList
A cutting-edge feature for autonomously listing Pi Coin as a stablecoin with a fixed value of $314,159 across exchanges registered in the Revolutica ecosystem. This module leverages quantum-resistant cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), cross-chain interoperability, and AI-driven compliance to ensure secure, scalable, and decentralized operations.
## Features
- Automated Listing: Seamlessly lists Pi Coin on exchanges using smart contracts (AutoListing.sol).
- Cross-Chain Bridging: Supports listing across multiple blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Stellar, Binance Smart Chain) via CrossChainBridge.sol.
- Price Stability: Maintains Pi Coin's fixed value of $314,159 using an integrated price oracle.
- AI Compliance: Ensures regulatory compliance (KYC/AML) with AI-driven analysis.
- Decentralized Governance: Allows the Pi Network community to validate listings through a voting mechanism.
- Quantum-Resistant Security: Incorporates ECDSA and ZKP for future-proof security.
## Prerequisites
- Node.js: Version 18.x or higher for running the governance dashboard.
- Python: Version 3.9 or higher for AI modules and deployment scripts.
- Solidity: Version ^0.8.20 for compiling smart contracts.
- Docker: Required for containerized deployment (e.g., on Raspberry Pi nodes).
- Web3 Provider: Access to a blockchain node (e.g., Infura, local Ganache, or Pi Network node).
- Dependencies: Install project dependencies via requirements.txt and npm.
- Exchange API Configuration: Configure exchange endpoints in config/exchanges.json.
- ZKP Library: Optional, for full ZKP implementation (e.g., circom or snarkjs).
## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the Pi AutoSync StableList feature:
1. Clone the Repository:
   `bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/Revolutica
   `
2. Navigate to the Directory:
   `bash
   cd Revolutica/PiAutoSyncStableList
   `
3. Install Python Dependencies:
   `bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   `
4. Install Node.js Dependencies (for dashboard):
   `bash
   npm install
   `
5. Configure Environment:
   Copy config/.env.example to config/.env:
     `bash
     cp config/.env.example config/.env
     `
   Update config/.env with your settings (e.g., NETWORK_URL, PRIVATE_KEY, contract addresses).
6. Deploy Smart Contracts:
   Compile and deploy AutoListing.sol and CrossChainBridge.sol:
     `bash
     python scripts/deploy_contracts.py
     `
   Note the deployed contract addresses and update config/.env accordingly.
7. Run Exchange Synchronization:
   Sync Pi Coin listing with exchanges:
     `bash
     python scripts/sync_exchanges.py config/exchanges.json 
     `
8. Start Governance Dashboard:
   Launch the frontend for community governance:
     `bash
     npm start --prefix dashboard
     `
## Directory Structure
- /contracts: Contains smart contracts for listing (AutoListing.sol) and cross-chain bridging (CrossChainBridge.sol).
- /ai: AI modules for compliance (compliance_engine.py) and price oracle (price_oracle.py).
- /scripts: Deployment and synchronization scripts (deploy_contracts.py, sync_exchanges.py).
- /config: Configuration files, including exchanges.json and .env.
- /dashboard: Frontend for decentralized governance (governance_dashboard.js).
- /tests: Unit tests for listing (test_listing.py) and price stability (test_stability.py).
- /lib: Libraries for ZKP verification (ZKProofVerifier.sol).
## Running Tests
Ensure the environment is configured and a blockchain node is running (e.g., Ganache or testnet).
1. Install Test Dependencies:
   `bash
   pip install pytest web3 python-dotenv eth-account
   `
2. Run Tests:
   `bash
   pytest -v tests/test_listing.py tests/test_stability.py
   `
3. Test Coverage:
   test_listing.py: Validates exchange registration, proposal creation, voting, and cross-chain bridging.
   test_stability.py: Ensures price stability at $314,159 during listing and bridging.
4. Deployment with Docker
- Build Docker Image:
   `bash
   docker build -t pi-autosync-stablelist:latest .
   `
- Run Docker Container:
   `bash
   docker run --env-file config/.env -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs pi-autosync-stablelist:latest
   `
- Verify Deployment:
   Check logs at logs/pi_autosync_stablelist.log for deployment status.
   Monitor contract events using a blockchain explorer.
## Security Considerations
- Private Keys: Store PRIVATE_KEY and ECDSA_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY securely (e.g., in a vault like AWS Secrets Manager).
- .env Protection: Exclude config/.env from version control by adding it to .gitignore.
- Contract Auditing: Audit AutoListing.sol and CrossChainBridge.sol using tools like MythX or Slither before deployment.
- ZKP Implementation: Use production-ready ZKP libraries (e.g., circom) for ZKProofVerifier.sol.
- Relayer Security: Authorize trusted relayers in CrossChainBridge.sol to prevent unauthorized bridging.
## Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance the Pi AutoSync StableList feature. To contribute:
1. Fork the Repository:
   `bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/Revolutica
   `
2. Create a Feature Branch:
   `bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   `
3. Make Changes:
   Add new features, fix bugs, or improve documentation.
   Ensure tests pass: pytest -v tests/.
4. Submit a Pull Request:
   Push changes to your fork and create a pull request to the main branch of KOSASIH/Revolutica.
   Include a detailed description of your changes and reference relevant issues.
5. Code Standards:
   Follow Solidity style guidelines (e.g., OpenZeppelin conventions).
   Use clear, descriptive variable names and comments.
   Ensure all tests pass and new tests are added for new features.
## Troubleshooting
- Contract Deployment Fails: Verify NETWORK_URL and PRIVATE_KEY in .env. Ensure sufficient gas and funds.
- Exchange Sync Issues: Check exchanges.json for valid API endpoints and EXCHANGE_API_TIMEOUT.
- Price Oracle Errors: Confirm PRICE_ORACLE_ENDPOINT is accessible and returns the correct value (314159 * 10^18).
- Cross-Chain Bridging: Ensure SUPPORTED_CHAINS and BRIDGE_RELAYER_ADDRESS are correctly configured.
